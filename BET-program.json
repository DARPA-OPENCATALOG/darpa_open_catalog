    "Description": "The objective of the Binary Executable Transforms (BET) program is to produce revolutionary technologies for analyzing, identifying, and slicing binary executable components.  Binary executable components are defined as a fully encapsulated set of subroutines, data structures, imported APIs, objects, and global variables that accomplish a particular function. Specifically, BET is seeking innovative research in: &bull; Automatically analyzing and identifying binary executable functional components. &bull; Automatically slicing and extracting identified binary functional components into reusable programming modules, including defined inputs and outputs. &bull; Combining static and dynamic binary analysis to increase understanding and function of binary executables. &bull; Exploring formal verification methods to prove functional component properties. &bull; Developing intermediate representation language to support program slicing. &bull; Developing core technology to enable exploration and research for the BET program.",
