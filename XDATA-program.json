        "Description": "XDATA is a DARPA program that seeks to develop computational techniques and software tools for analyzing large volumes of data, both semi-structured (e.g., tabular, relational, categorical) and unstructured (e.g., text documents, message traffic). The central challenges we are addressing include developing scalable algorithms for processing imperfect data in distributed data stores and creating effective human-computer interaction tools for facilitating rapidly customizable visual reasoning for diverse missions. Novel aspects of the XDATA program include the embracing of open source technologies and a focus on minimizing design-to-testing time of new software by using near continual feedback from users. ",

        "Description": "XDATA, a program run out of in the Information Innovation Office (I2O), is developing an open source software library for big data to overcome the challenges of effectively scaling its volume and characteristics. The program is developing the tools and techniques to process and analyze large sets of imperfect, incomplete data. Its programs and publications focus on the areas of Analytics, Visualization, and Infrastructure to efficiently fuse, analyze, and disseminate these massive volumes of data.",
