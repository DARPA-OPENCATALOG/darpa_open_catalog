    "Description":"The Memex program is creating the next generation of search technologies. Memex is doing this by focusing domain-specific indexing and user community specific interfaces. The ability to identify and index domains that are unique to individual users and groups of users will enable these users to have access to more information than what is available under traditional search technologies. The creation of an interface that goes beyond the search bar and ten blue links for results will enable these users to see connections via shared content, trends over location and time, and ultimately expand their view of what information is available to them.",
