Initiated by DARPA, this is a multi-year project working in conjunction with many different institutions and organizations, such as the Sesame Workshop and Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute. The end-product will be a series of multi-platform games that apply adaptive, in-game analytics for Pre-K-3rd graders that inspires interest and teaches basic concepts in the field of science.
